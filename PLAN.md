# Project Plan

This project will be executed in the following phases:

### Phase 1: Setup and Discovery (Completed)

*   **Objective:** Establish a baseline understanding of the existing Zendesk environment.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [x] Create project documentation files (`README.md`, `PLAN.md`, `ZENDESK_API_NOTES.md`, `CONSTRAINTS.md`, `DECISION_LOG.md`).
    *   [x] Write a Python script to connect to the Zendesk API.
    *   [x] Export a list of all current custom ticket fields and tags.
    *   [x] Present the findings for review.

### Phase 2: Core Logic and Testing (In Progress)

*   **Objective:** Develop the main application logic and ensure it's testable.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [x] Develop the core application logic to read the input spreadsheet (`.xlsx`/`.csv`).
    *   [ ] Implement the business rules for determining the ticket requestor based on "employee" status.
    *   [ ] Format the ticket data, including the detailed comment section.
    *   [ ] Implement a test mode for creating and deleting a single ticket for verification purposes.
    *   [ ] Build in robust error handling, including graceful management of API rate limits (`429 Too Many Requests`).
    *   [ ] Implement detailed logging for all operations.

### Phase 3: Rollout and Verification

*   **Objective:** Execute the bulk ticket creation and verify the results.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] Execute the script for the initial batch of devices (those already past EOL).
    *   [ ] Develop and execute a process to analyze the application logs.
    *   [ ] Verify the successful creation of all tickets and identify any failures for remediation.

### Phase 4: Workflow and Documentation

*   **Objective:** Finalize project documentation and workflows.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] Draft the workflow for technicians to handle the created tickets.
    *   [ ] Provide `git` commands and best practices for managing the project in the specified GitHub repository.
    *   [ ] Ensure all code is well-commented and file headers are descriptive as requested.
